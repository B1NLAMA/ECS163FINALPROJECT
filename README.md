# ECS163FINALPROJECT

Here we will write about what kind of visualizations we are implementing.

In the list below, we will write an update for what is the progress for the visualizations.

# Line Chart

# Calendar Chart

# Bubble Chart
I have not started on it yet. Still thinking about the data.

# Parallel Coordinates
I have plotted the parallel coordinates chart but I need to improve the brushing and selecting.
I also need to improve the filter.
I need to filter by using the tags too not just the year.

# Embedded video
I have not started on this yet.
